        <h2>A Little About Me!</h2>
        <p>I am a recent graduate from the Thinkful Fullstack Flex program. I enjoy coding because of
            the perfect balance between structure and creativity. It allows me to achieve new challenges everyday and
            think critically about various problems and situations. I love finding new concepts and ways of attacking
            the problem to achieve maximum readability and functionality. I have a passion for working on a team and
            pride myself on being a good teammate and a hard worker.
            <br>
                Aside from coding, I love to hike, explore new restaurants, and spend a day wine tasting in Woodinville
            right outside of Seattle. I pride myself on my work ethic and salesmanship that I have worked on my whole
            life, serving in top steakhouses around the country. Coding gives me a great sense of achievement and
            accomplishment and imparts the challenge I have always longed for in a career.
